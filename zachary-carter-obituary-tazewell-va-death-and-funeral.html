Zachary’s journey, though tragically short, was marked by love, passion, and a commitment to his work and his education. Zachary was born on February 14, 2001, in Crawfordsville, a day synonymous with love, which would come to be a defining characteristic of his life. His parents, Robert (Chris) and Lisa (Crowder) Carter, welcomed him into the world, and from that moment on, he became a cherished member of their family.</p><p>Zachary’s work as a medical dispatcher at S.T.A.R Ambulance in Crawfordsville exemplified his dedication to helping others in their time of need. His role as a dispatcher required not only technical skills but also a compassionate heart, which he undoubtedly possessed. His contribution to the community in this role was invaluable. Beyond his professional life, Zachary had a deep passion for photography. He had an incredible ability to capture the beauty of the world around him and shared this with his friends and family. Through his lens, he brought the world to life, showing others the wonders that surrounded them.</p><p>Zachary’s commitment to education was another testament to his drive and ambition. He had already made plans to further his knowledge and skills by enrolling in a program for computer and information science at Vincennes University in Vincennes. His pursuit of higher education showcased his determination to make a positive impact on the world through his studies.</p><p>As we remember and honor Zachary’s life, we find solace in the love, dedication, and the positive impact he made during his short time with us. Our thoughts and condolences go out to Zachary’s family and friends who are grappling with the profound loss of a bright and promising young soul. His memory will forever remain in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know him, and his legacy will continue to inspire others to embrace life with compassion, dedication, and a love for its beauty. May Zachary “Zach” Thomas Carter rest in peace, and may his family find strength and comfort in the warm embrace of the memories they shared with him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwxsCcn5qqqWKwor7Tnqlmp5Kewbat0bJkrZmqmsSmuMtmrZpllJqutbSMmqWdZZaqu6a%2BwKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
