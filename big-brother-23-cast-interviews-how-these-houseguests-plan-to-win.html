So it’s got this casino meets beach, Monte Carlo meets beach club, meets Vegas, kind of feel to it.”</p><p>Longtime host <a href=#><strong>Julie Chen-Moonves</strong></a> echoed that sentiment <a href=#>in our interview with her</a>, adding, “It’s definitely a gambler’s summer. … We’re also introducing a new competition that will unveil itself on the first Sunday night show. You’re not just going to find out the two people that the Head of Household has nominated for eviction, you’re also going to have this other competition with a whole other layer to it.”</p><p>In addition, the players will be divided into teams during the premiere “and they’re doing this based off of first impressions,” Chen explained. “They’re going to be presented with a little snippet of a houseguest describing himself or herself. And then what’s really going to heat things up is after the teams are formed, the four captains are going to compete for one of them to become Head of Household.”</p><p>How will the new houseguests adapt to these twists?
