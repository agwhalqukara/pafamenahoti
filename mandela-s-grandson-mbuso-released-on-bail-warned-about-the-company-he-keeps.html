Teffo is defending four out of five men who are being accused of killing the famed <a href=#>soccer</a> player.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement issued by the Office of the Chief Justice, Zondo <a href=#>condemned the police's conduct</a> and found the way they carried out the arrest warrant unacceptable. Zondo stated that upon reviewing the footage, Zondo said the fact that Teffo was arrested inside the same <a href=#>court</a> he had been carrying out his work was inappropriate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLGxzqmjnmdhZ4N4hJhmpJqmlJq5or%2BMoKmappSovK95zJusrKddp7KtscCsnJ1lkpa2rXnWmqmnnZRisLC5z5qlsmWbmrKxv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
