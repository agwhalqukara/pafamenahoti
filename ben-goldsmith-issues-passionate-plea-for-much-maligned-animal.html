"The beautiful but utterly denuded Highlands of Scotland show what happens in wild landscapes stripped of their wolves," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d6b5c9cc5390-wolf-germany.jpg><p id=efeWzhI07T data-wc=59>"<strong>Deer numbers explode, stripping the hills and glens of their young trees, rich scrub and wildflowers and unleashing an ecosystem collapse&nbsp;</strong>which the Highlands, and Ireland, have in common with swathes of Sicily. The absence of wolves is felt more acutely still in our agriculturally productive landscapes, where food production is now threatened by growing hordes of hungry deer."</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>DONATE NOW</p></a><p id=eymrGHbVSf data-wc=73>However, despite wolves being so important for the natural food chain, they are still facing issues from people who worry about their reputation and farmers who are worried that the animals may attack their own livestock. "On the continent however, wolves are back in growing numbers, and with them, calls for eradication from a small but vociferous minority," Ben told us. "The killing of wolves has already begun in Sweden, Norway and Switzerland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/670a85f8b298-ben-goldsmith-zac-goldsmith.jpg><p id=evtgNELD3Y data-wc=87>Disspelling some of the myths around wolves, he added: "<strong>The justification given is shaky, including the dangers posed by wolves to pets, livestock and even to people, even though wolves are timid, avoiding humans at all costs.&nbsp;</strong>Certainly, wolves are a nuisance for some livestock farmers, but the scale of the impact is substantially overstated. France's burgeoning wolf population accounted for just 0.2% of all the sheep lost to natural causes last year. Meanwhile, increasingly effective wolf coexistence measures are being rolled out across Europe’s pastoral landscapes.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Introducing the royal family's inspiring eco warrior Marina Windsor as she talks desire to protect the planet" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7e13f77ab5fe-timagecover.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Introducing the royal family's inspiring eco warrior Marina Windsor as she talks desire to protect the planet" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Introducing the royal family's inspiring eco warrior Marina Windsor as she talks desire to protect the planet</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Springwatch's Chris Packham and stepdaughter Megan McCubbin unite for heartwarming cause" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9999823112ba-chris-packham-megan.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Springwatch's Chris Packham and stepdaughter Megan McCubbin unite for heartwarming cause" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Springwatch's Chris Packham and stepdaughter Megan McCubbin unite for heartwarming cause</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Renegade Nell star Adrian Lester on the importance of Shakespeare in children's education" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8b9668aff9b6-adrian-lester-renegade-nell.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Renegade Nell star Adrian Lester on the importance of Shakespeare in children's education" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Renegade Nell star Adrian Lester on the importance of Shakespeare in children's education</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eB0zMEHKOX data-wc=64>"How can we lecture countries far poorer than ours on co-existence with leopards, lions and tigers if we can’t find it within ourselves to tolerate secretive, far-less-scary wolves in our own midst?
