He runs Trojon Contractors alongside his wife, Kristy. They work with over 100 local builders, developers and companies to manufacture and install fences in the Territory.</p><p>“We opened the doors to Trojon Contractors the day after a cyclone smashed through Darwin with almost every third fence damaged in some way. It was all in all at once. Which in turn prepared us for another cyclone, or in this case, a pandemic like COVID-19,” Mr Owen said.</p><p>Thanks to the all-local operation (even the manufacturing of the fences happens smack bang in the NT), the business was able to keep running.</p><p>“But it didn’t come easy, and we didn’t know what the next day would bring,” Mr Owen said. “The stress and the late nights behind closed doors was intense. We didn’t stress for ourselves; we stressed for our employees who all have families, and all we wanted was to keep them employed and keep them paid.”</p><p>While he said it was “touch and go for a little bit”, the Government’s announcement of the $100 million Home Improvement Scheme offered the relief they needed. Part of the Jobs Rescue and Recovery Plan, the scheme meant homeowners could spend $1000 to receive a $4000 voucher for physical improvements to their property, or contribute $2000 to receive a $6000 voucher of the same kind. It was so popular, nearly one in three Territorian homeowners submitted an application and conservative government estimates show Territorians will spend $40 million of their own cash as part of the scheme.</p><p>“Things quickly escalated, and we managed to get 1020 quotes in. Kristy was often up until 1am sending them out,” Mr Owen said. “We didn’t know who applied, or who selected us — it could have been 10, or it could have been 110. But what a blessing it has been.”</p><p>Now, business is booming to the extent that Trojon Contractors currently employs two additional full-time staff members in a “solid crew” of nine teams.</p><p>Recently, they ran a competition to win $1000 worth of fencing. When Mr Owen realised the recipient required more than the prize to replace her fence, he replaced it all at no cost.</p><p>“We have the belief that you have to give back to the community that gives to you,” Mr Owen said.&nbsp;</p><p>He said the Territory is a “place like no other” and said it has been a great place to grow a business while raising a young family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmp6ufp7Kle8ZvhYGakXmbi7jFfGuSfIaklrWUjrCfsmWapK%2B0ecCrnGasmJp6p8HTrqmeZZakv27Ax55kp6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
