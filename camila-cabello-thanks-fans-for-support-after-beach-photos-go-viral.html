Please follow the lead of real beauty and truth. Not superficial ideas that are unrealistic, dangerous & manipulating.”</p><p>Cabello previously <a href=#>slammed body-shamers</a> in August 2019 after seeing an offensive headline about photos of herself. The <a href=#>Fifth Harmony alum</a> took to her Instagram Story to explain her feelings on the issue, noting that it goes beyond her hurt feelings.</p><p>“Honestly first thing I felt was super insecure just IMAGINING what these pictures must look like, oh no! My cellulite! Oh no! I didn’t suck in my stomach!” Cabello wrote at the time. “But then I was like… of course there are bad pictures, of course there are bad angles, my body’s not made of f–king rock, or all muscle, for that matter, but the saddest part of young girls growing up in an airbrushed world is they’re seeking a perfection that’s not real.”</p><p>She continued by explaining that she worries about the kids who see such headlines as well as edited social media images. Specifically, she thinks about her sister Sofia, who is 10 years younger than the <a href=#>Cinderella star</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Camila-Cabello-Thanks-Fans-for-Support-After-Beach-Photos-Go-Viral-Inline.jpg><p>“I’m writing this for girls like my little sister who are growing up on social media,” she added.</p><p>“They’re constantly seeing photoshopped, edited pictures and thinking that’s reality, and everyone’s eyes get used to seeing airbrushed skin, an suddenly they think THAT’S the norm. ?!!! It isn’t. It’s fake. AND FAKE IS BECOMING THE NEW REAL. We have a completely unrealistic view of a woman’s body. Girls, cellulite is normal, fat is normal. It’s beautiful and natural. I won’t buy into bulls–t today!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmZ2euaJ5wpqZnqScpHq1tMCnoqxllpa7tHnFqKlmq6WlvbC%2B02aYn6yVp3qjscCcn2aomKTBsL%2BMoKZmrpmnrq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
