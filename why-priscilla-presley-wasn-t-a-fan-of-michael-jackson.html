But according to Priscilla, there was tension behind the scenes, as she worried about the "Thriller" pop star's motivations for marrying her daughter.</p><p>In 2012, she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, "Lisa knew I wasn't happy about her marrying Michael Jackson. We had issues over it because of my experience of marrying somebody with that same iconic status and in a strange way maybe history was repeating itself." Priscilla speculated on the similarities, suggesting, "Maybe she saw something of Elvis in Michael. As her mom though I was concerned as I could see it could be a disaster. At that point, the right thing to do would have been to bite my tongue, but I didn't bite my tongue."&nbsp;Later in <a href=#>2015</a>, she admitted to the same outlet that she doubted how "authentic" her daughter's love was. "You know, I just didn't know if it was authentic or not. I just worried about if she was doing the right thing. I worried about ... his agendas."</p><p>In 2019, James Safechuk, who accused Jackson of child sexual molestation in the explosive "Leaving Neverland" documentary, alleged that the marriage to Presley was part of Jackson's agenda to distract the media and public from his 1993 allegations, per the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. Jackson's family has <a href=#>denied the sexual abuse allegations</a> against him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWxgbYB1e9ahsGaoop7ApLXLpZhmqKKawK2x2GaumqueqXqiecWapWanlmK6qq%2FHmpylZZqWsKy%2Fzqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
