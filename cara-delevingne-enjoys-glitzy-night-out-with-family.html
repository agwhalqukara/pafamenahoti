As well as spending some quality time with her father and sisters, Cara was spotted mingling with the star-studded guestlist which included <strong>Pixie Lott, Lilah Parsons and Henry Holland</strong>. The young model also took the opportunity to show off her musical talent, surprising party goers as she hopped onstage for a performance with the band.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfabf0d00fc4-cara-a.jpg><p id=eKgozTMKHwPk data-wc=12><strong>Cara rocked an all-black ensemble and bold make-up look for the evening</strong></p><p id=ecqkF1gGKafj data-wc=153>Meanwhile, <strong>older sisters Poppy and Chloe showed that style runs in the family</strong>, holding their own in fashion-forward outfits. <a class=hm-link href=#>Poppy, who had been in Milan with husband James Cook the night before</a>, chose a laidback chic outfit as she supported her younger sister. The 28-year-old fashionista rocked a pair of bright red trousers for a pop of colour, which she paired with a grey sleeveless vest, black fringed Chanel bag and black leather stilettos. Meanwhile <strong>Chloe kept out the winter chill with a stylish, multi-coloured and striped fluffy coat</strong> and showed off her enviably slender figure with black skinny leggings, completing the look with a pair of black stilettos. The stylish sisters are taking care of father Charles following the sad news <a class=hm-link href=#>that their paternal grandmother has passed away, aged 102</a>. It seems that the evening did lift Charles' spirits as he was all smiles while he enjoyed quality time with his daughters.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
