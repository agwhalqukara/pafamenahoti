Como’s music remained popular throughout his life, and he was once referred to by his idol Bing Crosby as “the man who invented casual”.</p><p id=ew-P0KSm-U-Z data-wc=78>This weekend the world also said goodbye to Douglas Adams, author of <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy,</i> who died suddenly aged 49. Adams suffered a heart attack on Friday morning in California while exercising at a local gym. “It’s the most awful kind of bereavement because there’s no time to prepare for it,” said his friend and business partner Robbie Stamp. “He liked to keep fit. It was something we’d both joked about: being middle-aged and exercising.”</p><p id=e0jqPXFusdEz data-wc=82>The author’s <i>Hitchiker</i> series, dubbed “a trilogy in four parts”, sold 14 million copies worldwide and was turned into a successful BBC TV series. Alan Yentob, director of drama and entertainment for the BBC, praised the author, saying: “Douglas was a big character who will be hugely missed by a host of friends and millions of fans around the world. He was a gifted writer; a one-off talent who managed to combine fantasy and humanity in books which enthralled generations of readers.”</p><p id=eUb2YViOXAmF data-wc=23>Adams is survived by his wife of ten years, Jane Belson, and their daughter. Como is survived by two sons and a daughter.</p><p id=eNA91t_yr1Fs data-wc=77>One of India’s best loved novelists, RK Narayan, also died this weekend. Naryan, a friend of the late author Graham Greene, is famous for his vivid portrayal of daily life in India. His first novel, <i>Swami And His Friends</i> appeared in 1935 and was followed by numerous novels, short stories and essays including his 1982 book <i>Malgudi Days</i> which was turned into a popular TV serial. The prolific writer, whose wife and daughter predeceased him, was 94.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
