Born in Canouan, Saint Vincent, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in 1975, Adonal Foyle was interested in basketball from a young age, and eventually played high school basketball in the United States in New York after he was adopted to university professors when he was 15 years old. After that, Foyle attended and played college basketball at Colgate University, where his parents also worked. He was honored as the Patriot League Player of the Year twice in both 1996 and 1997. His professional basketball career with the National Basketball Association began in earnest when the Golden State Warriors drafted him with the eighth overall pick during the first round of the 1997 NBA Draft. He played with the Golden State Warriors for ten years before joining up with the Orlando Magic from 2007 until 2009, followed by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2009, and later the Magic a second time in 2009. After going through a significant knee operation, Foyle made the decision to retire. He finished his career with a handful of pretty impressive stats: 2,989 total points scored, 3,461 rebounds, and 1,193 blocked shots.</p><p>Off the court, Foyle is known as a political activist and poet who has written for "HOOP" Magazine. He is also the founder of the student activist group Democracy Matters, which works for the cause of increasing political involvement across college campuses. The organization has branches at more than 50 schools. Foyle also created the Kerosene Lamp Foundation to aid children in his native country. He earned his U.S. citizenship in 2007 and began his work with the National Basketball Players Association Executive Committee. Foyle published his first book, "Too Tall Foyle Finds His Game", in 2013 for kids. He is a member of the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6OtjpqbqKaRoXqnu9ilnGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
