She dated Derrick in around 2007, as&nbsp;mentioned in a 2007 Chicago Tribune Profile of&nbsp;Rose. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Dana now has a six-year-old&nbsp;daughter with Jae&nbsp;named&nbsp;Jada.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The dating relationship between Jae and Dana has been far from smooth. Dana has called out her boyfriend multiple times on social media for his infidelity. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The first time Dana called Jae out for his disloyalty was in&nbsp;September of 2018. Dana accused Jae of having cheated on her with Marliesia Ortiz. However, she didn’t provide any evidence supporting the accusations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also Read:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Garcelle Beauvais Shuts Cheating Husband For Children; Family First - Actress Reveals" rel=follow>Garcelle Beauvais Shuts Cheating Husband For Children; Family First - Actress Reveals</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Later,&nbsp;the same day that she revealed Jae and Marliesia’s relationship, Dana brought Jae and&nbsp;Just Tokyo’s affair into the spotlight. Dana took to her Instagram to do a series of stories mentioning Jae and Just. Just was in a relationship with retired NFL star Andre Johnson when the incident&nbsp;occurred.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Dana again called Jae out for his indecent acts late-October 2018 when she found out Jae was allegedly cheating on her with Dre Cabrera.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, Dana herself isn’t so clean when it comes to disloyalty in a relationship. She, too, had had her fill with shame when her boyfriend called her and her alleged hook-up Robert Covington out on Instagram. But, Jae did this in August of 2018, a month before Dana had her turn of lashing accusations at him.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jae acted like he was okay with Dana and Robert’s relationship. It could be because he was himself involved in extra-marital relationships, but these are just speculations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>But, for now, Jada’s parents seem to have moved on from both of their turbulent past. They are now happy together and taking care of Jada. Only time will tell how long will this peace between the two last.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jae Crowder with Dana Lambert at 99 Paradise on 19th September 2019</strong> (Photo: Jae Crowder's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As for their marital status, Jae and Dana are not married. It’s been only a year since they had a spout, and a wedding could be the last thing on their minds.
