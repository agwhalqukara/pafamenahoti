Zuma, known for his involvement in calling for the destruction of Brookside Mall in Pietermaritzburg, Kwa-Zulu Natal, was handed a 12-year sentence. South Africans cried for Malema to help him as they felt an injustice was done.</p><h2>Malema to help July 2021 unrest convict</h2><p class=align-left>Malema tweeted on his x account, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@Julius_Malema</a>, after Zuma was <a href=#>sentenced to 12 years imprisonment</a>. Zuma was found guilty of trying to incite residents to loot a <a href=#>mall</a> in Pietermaritzburg. Malema's tweet expressed that he did not think Zuma was properly legally represented. He added that he called on his KZN Provincial Chair to investigate the case and find a way to assist <a href=#>Zuma</a>. Read the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> here:</p><h2>South Africans stan Malema</h2><p class=align-left>Netizens fawned over Malema and his decision to support Zuma.</p><p class=align-left>Khanyisile said:</p>“Malema, how I love you. Please change your policy about foreigners because we love you. We will vote for you. You are the future.”<p class=align-left>Sandiso_NM wrote:</p>“I will vote for you, but the thing is, I’m not quite convinced. As soon as you stop allowing illegal immigrants from looming around in your county, I will vote for you.”<p class=align-left>@Jabutedd added:</p>“One day, as a society, we must have an honest discussion about our criminal justice system.”<p class=align-left>Count Peccio-X:</p>“You have spoken as the true leader of the African people. This was an apartheid-style lynching using apartheid laws.”<p class=align-left>Some were unhappy.</p><p class=align-left>Gangster Whose Real Name is Clarence observed:</p>“Seems like you’re always supporting people on the wrong side of the law.”<p class=align-left>Sparx was suspicious.</p>“Only now, at the sentencing stage, you want to assist.”<h2>Malema demands rand manipulation culprits come forth</h2><p class=align-left>In a Malema-related story, <strong>Briefly News</strong> wrote that the CIC of the <a href=#>EFF</a> demanded that <a href=#>those behind the rand manipulation be revealed</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Malema said that the faces behind the 28 banks allegedly involved in manipulating the current over ten years ago be exposed, and <a href=#>South Africans</a> joined in his call, demanding that they show themselves and take responsibility for their actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLG7y6KropujZH54gJVwbGaipaG2tr%2BMppilnZ2WeqK%2F0qKqrWViZX9yecmuo7JlpaO%2Fpr%2FTZpqopqaesLV50qisraBdlrOztcKapaxllJqvosDEZqCnrJWjwaq7zaxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
