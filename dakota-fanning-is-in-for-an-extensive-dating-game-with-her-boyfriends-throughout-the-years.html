Dakota and Henry quickly became a staple in various red-carpet events. After making their red carpet debut in the 2018 Prada event, the smitten couple often attended shows together.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>Who is Elle Fanning Boyfriend in 2023?

Unfortunately, it was the last time the couple was spotted together, considering Dakota no longer posts pictures of Henry on her Instagram, and the paps keep failing to capture them together.</p><p>Furthermore, during the COVID-19 quarantine in 2020, Dakota made it clear that she quarantined with her family only, without any glimpse, which might indicate Henry was part of the crew.</p><p>It seems safe to claim that Dakota is officially back on the market, guys!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Dakota Fanning’s Rekindled Romance with Her High School Beau</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-and-Logan-Markley.jpg><p>Shortly after her much-debated romance with model Jamie Strachan ended in 2016, Dakota Fanning didn’t waste time to move on! This time, it was with her ex-boyfriend from high school, <strong>Logan Markley</strong>.</p><p>The rekindled old flame was spotted holding hands while strolling around the busy streets of New York with smiles on their faces. Dakota and Logan reportedly dated for a year while studying at North Hollywood’s Campbell Hall Episcopal High School.</p><p>A source also <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a> that Dakota and Logan “have always been close” despite their failed romance in high school. Unfortunately, their second try at love didn’t succeed either, as they (once again) broke up in early 2017.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did Dakota Fanning and Jamie Strachan Break Up?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-ex-boyfriend-Jamie-Strachan.jpg><p>Dakota Fanning might be the least problematic former child star in Hollywood, but one of her past relationships caused quite a backlash. Yep, in 2014, just shortly after she turned 20, Dakota started dating English model <strong>Jamie Strachan</strong>. This romance raised several eyebrows, considering that Dakota was barely legal and Jami was 13 years older than her!</p><p>However, Dakota ignored the negative comments and put forward her happiness above all, claiming that “it’s really fun to have someone to experience things with.”</p><p>“People love who they love, and you go with that,” the actress told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Times</a>. “I’m super happy,” she added, claiming that being with Jamie “feels right.”</p><p>However, their romance didn’t last long, as the couple broke up in 2016 after around four years of dating. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Town & Country</a>, Dakota candidly addressed the reason for their separation: Jamie talked bad behind her back!</p><p class=related-post>See Also: <a href=#>Who Is Robert Pattinson Girlfriend?

They were even once involved in a brief dating rumor back in 2009 after they were reportedly having dinner together as teenagers!</p><p>“People have often asked me about you,” Freddie told Dakota on an episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety’s Actors on Actors</a>. “Like, what was it like to date Dakota,” he continued, to which Dakota reacted with a full-bellied laugh.</p><p>Freddie also addressed that the picture of them dining together (the one that sparked the romance rumors) was a dinner to discuss the movie they “never ended up doing together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibopqytbuNnKamZ5SWuLDAwGadmqaenruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
