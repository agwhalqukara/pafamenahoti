Kim Kardashian visited The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday, Sept. 30, where she discussed Kanye West’s recent announcement that he plans to run for president in 2020. 
Apparently, the “All Day” rapper did not prep his wife for the big reveal prior to making his declaration at the 2015 VMAs in late August. 
“That was news to me,” she said, adding that he’d never even broached the subject with her before."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t know if that was planned, and I just didn’t know about it, or if he came up with that idea right then and there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Does Kardashian, 34, who has previously lent her support to 2016 candidate <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, think she’ll one day be sitting in the Oval Office alongside her president husband? If so, she doesn’t think it will look the same as it currently does.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am looking forward to what’s to come,” she said, adding, “I think it would be so much fun to be in the White House. I was joking with him, I was like, ‘You’re going to have to make it to a second term,’ because he loves redecorating. So I was like, ‘You’re going to want to redo the whole White House, and we’re not going to be able to enjoy it.’”</p><p><strong>Tell Us: </strong>Would you vote for Kanye West for president?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYriiutieZLCdo6l6tLHRoqauq12Wr7DB02aprqaenruoec%2BrnKyhlJq7tXmRaWhua2Bu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
