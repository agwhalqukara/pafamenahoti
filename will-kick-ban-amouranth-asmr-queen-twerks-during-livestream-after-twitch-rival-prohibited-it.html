Kick is a new competitor to Twitch that, like others before it, is attempting to gain market share by luring high-profile talent away from the Amazon-owned network. This has so far involved Amouranth, Destiny, and xQc."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Less than a month later, some are speculating that she should be suspended for violating community rules by "twerking" on broadcast.</p><p>Kick is a new competitor to Twitch that, like others before it, is attempting to gain market share by luring high-profile talent away from the Amazon-owned network. This has so far involved Amouranth, Destiny, and xQc.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Is Amouranth getting banned on Kick?</h2><p>Kick co-founder Eddie Craven clearly said that "twerking" is against the platform's regulations back in April, but only when done in return for "subs/money." As of this writing, Amouranth's Kick channel is still active. She barely moved there a month ago, yet now her account has 100,000 followers. Her average daily viewers on Kick were 11,282 compared to 6,538 on Twitch over the course of the last 30 days.</p><p>Amouranth is streaming on Kick significantly more frequently than Twitch, which may be because of the larger cash generated by the 95% sub share offered to streamers on Kick as opposed to Twitch's 50/50 split.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>‘Sexually suggestive content’</h2><p>The most popular female broadcaster on Twitch, Amouranth, had also been one of the most contentious to receive bans in the past. There are still limits concerning what content is permitted, despite the fact that some people think Kick is more lax in terms of community norms.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Kick has a guideline that says "sexually suggestive content" is not allowed, which includes "erotic or sexually suggestive dancing or gestures." Amouranth started "twerking" on July 16 when the song's lyrics instructed her to put her hands on her knees. She was doing a DJ set on her stream at the time.</p><p>The clip was posted to Reddit under the headline "Kick TOS: twerking is bannable. Amouranth:" after several viewers believed this would violate these rules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5mhuW63yJyiZpqRo3qiuc6uqZqmpJ16or%2FMq2SqrZWau27A1p6ppKtdmcKztc2gZKWhpprAtb7EmqRmmZapsrN507CgrZuYYr%2BqwsClZKmqn522o7XTnptmoaQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
