The IPO is hoping to price shares at $14 to $16, with a total of 200 million Class A shares available, valuing the company up to $22 billion. The co-founders are the company's largest shareholders, with a combined total of 89% of the voting rights after the IPO. Their initial plan is to sell 16 million Class A shares, which will&nbsp;come with voting rights. This will leave them with the same decision making power over the future of the company as before the IPO.</p><p>When the company goes public, Spiegel will receive an award of 3% of the stock as CEO which will be valued at up to $588 million. Spiegel's base salary will be reduced to $1 when the IPO is registered, and his bonus (up to an annual $1 million) will be based on the company performing well. This prospective bonus will put him at double his previous salary of $500 thousand,</p><p>According to their filings, Murphy was only making $250 thousand as of December 31st. It remains to be seen how the new contract will address this difference.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-215780 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-487373209.jpg alt width=900 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-215780 class=wp-caption-text>Jemal Countess/Getty Images</p><p>Aside from Spiegel and Murphy, other individual stakeholders include board member Mitch Lasky, who will make up to $171 million from 10.7 million shares, and chairman of the board Michael Lynton, who can make nearly $900k from selling around 55k shares. The venture capital firms who were early investors are also reaping their rewards for their intelligent insights. Lightspeed Partners stands to make up to $74 million from selling 4.6 million shares, while General Catalyst can make up to $9 million with around 550k shares.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoqqeZoGKwsLLOrqWdnaKoerG4wKdkrJ2coXp2fZGmZKygkaeytHnSraaco18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
