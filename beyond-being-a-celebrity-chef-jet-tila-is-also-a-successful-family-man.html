"We met when I was teaching cooking classes over a decade ago," Jet said at the time. "We haven't stopped cooking together since."</p><p>In the time since, Jet and Ali have co-authored a cookbook titled 101 Epic Dishes: Recipes That Teach You How to Make the Classics Even More Delicious and Ali has developed a following of her own as a chef.
